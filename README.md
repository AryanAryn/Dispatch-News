---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AryanAryn/Dispatch-News.git
cd Dispatch-News
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_SPORTSDB_KEY=3          # free public key; upgrade for higher rate limits
VITE_PROXY_URL=              # your Cloudflare Worker URL (see below)
```

> **No `VITE_NEWSAPI_KEY` needed.** Users enter their own key on first visit. It is stored in `localStorage` only and never sent to any server you control.

### 3. Site identity (for forks)

Open `src/config.js` and update the identity block at the top:

```js
export const SITE_NAME      = 'The Dispatch';
export const SITE_OWNER     = 'Your Name';
export const GITHUB_REPO    = 'https://github.com/you/your-fork';
export const GITHUB_PROFILE = 'https://github.com/you';
export const CONTACT_EMAIL  = 'you@example.com';
```

These values are used throughout the About, Privacy Policy, Terms, and Contact pages.

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). On first visit you will be prompted for your NewsAPI key. Vite proxies requests locally — no CORS issues.

### 5. Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

A ready-made workflow lives at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

1. **Enable Pages**: Settings → Pages → Source → **GitHub Actions**
2. **Add secret** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets):

   | Secret | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_SPORTSDB_KEY` | `3` or a paid key |

3. **Add variable** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables):

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_PROXY_URL` | your Cloudflare Worker URL |

4. Push to `main` — the workflow builds and deploys automatically.

## Cloudflare Worker (CORS Proxy)

NewsAPI blocks direct browser requests from non-`localhost` origins on the free plan. The worker in `worker/` is a transparent CORS proxy — the user's key is forwarded as the `X-Api-Key` header; no key is stored server-side.

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
cd worker && npm install && npm run deploy
```

Copy the printed worker URL into `.env` (`VITE_PROXY_URL=...`) and the GitHub repo variable of the same name.

> **CI/CD**: pushing any file under `worker/` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`. Requires a `CF_API_TOKEN` secret with *Workers Scripts: Edit* permission.

## Google AdSense

The publisher ID is set in `index.html` and `src/config.js`. To use your own:

1. Replace `ADSENSE_PUB_ID` in `src/config.js`
2. Replace the `<script>` tag in `index.html`
3. Update the `slot` prop on each `<AdUnit>` in `HomePage.jsx` and `CategoryPage.jsx`

Ads appear only after your site is reviewed and approved by Google AdSense (typically 2–4 weeks).
